The S edge can be bought for less than right now so I think that ' s a better deal I like your review , no I love your 😄 what you think about note ?
not where do you get these music it is damn good I prefer a lite .
You got one wrong .
Mi A comes with a + camera , not + No headphone jack = Deal breaker You are amazing I blame Lew for tempting me buy so many and my wallet .

Damn great 🤔🙌 Watching on MI A go video for MI ram Had it for a week , camera is really really good , could not ask for more .
is still better coz of t he battery life , storage and a headphone jack , while the A a type c port and better camera and also a better processor but it ' s not worth the sacrifice at least for me , oh and the Note is also about This was going to be my next phone until I took that headphone jack part a bit seriously .
This way , life would be hard for me .

I love how Unbox Therapy is n ' t a Phone Snob .

Still fighting with its battery .

Check out the Mi SE , it just more , for that you ' re getting more performance , a glass - metal construction , Super , are way smaller , it ' s quite a bit faster with a better , snapdragon and it does n ' t drop any of the good stuff from the Mi A , it ' s basically the premium version , and it up much better in of value to some .
Same with the F , it all the praise but for just a little more money you solve all the that the Poco F , but it ' s so Is it Stock Android U r best Bought the device to try it out , overall a good device but connection is pretty weak while my connection at home is very fast .
All the on this device seem weak while it ' s fine on paper .
I tried and and all that but the mobile connection and are on the low end , speed wise .
The rear camera is + for low light U need to try note pro It plus camera Good but with all the around and jumpy I ' m gon na need therapy myself .
Great camera in a very low budget 😋 : it ' s not + ...
I am quite confused been for a long time and i feel they are over priced for nothing .
what do you think of the Mi A lite I my mobile to and it ' s amazing does this phone do ¡¿¡¿ It ' s really annoying how all these great budget do n ' t have US .

I ca n ' t find it Try note No headphone jack tho ?
O You will replace it after week to galaxy s + 😂 Make video on mate pro Do the mi a lite version f or this one ?
I will prefer the latter no matter what Very rightly said .
buy a new phone and confused between A and poco f , so i need help note pro is better G you can get it for used but in great condition .
Real me pro is almost performance ... much better the price .. lower than up .. crazy to think that these at this price point would compete and beat some flagship of a few ago and even put up a fight with the new Does this work with at & t ?
The camera binning thing which in low light .
No Headphone jack sad If it was waterproof then yes , but its not so no .
s own note is a better deal : Expendable Storage , Bigger Battery , Almost as powerful `` Snapdragon `` , no imbalance , better display , almost similar camera experience .. sure it is n ' t Android One .. but there are stock android for it .
In love with this phone And still my second choice in the range even after a year of use 😍😍😍 First would be obviously ✌️✌️✌️ U r very serious today I am pro m at I bought it just ago !
It ' s also stock Android phone but it ' s not Android one phone and camera is little worse than this but still pretty good for and it snapdragon which is pretty good but behind a little bit in comparison to snapdragon Edit - it a battery so you can go to with this and leave your charger at home 😂 you will not find any power in thought 🤣 : song ?
were but no response from Mi yet Note pro How ' s Mi A to .
watching this on mi x 😭😭😭😭 No one can challenge mi with the price range Hey do the video of note Please , have never seen being unboxed reason ?
Mi A Lite , I am it right now .. 😃 Song name any I am a mi user mi is the worst company I had ever used i becomes heat and lag very much during gaming Is .

I know , I know , that is difficult to come what about a phone like the plus ?
I mean for an with ram , Bad screen durability .
But Camera is not so good .
And also , whats wrong with a headphone jack .
I would not be getting a mi A The headphone jack removal is simply a bad move , the phone does not need to be thinner than it was back in Mi A You ca n ' t even hold it without a case anyway .
And the removal of the jack did n ' t even mean that more battery life was added to it , instead it was made worse ?
There is no to expand your storage here .
They may have upon the camera , but it is worse than Mi A on all .
I have the mi a it ' s a very good phone for gaming but the battery is really really bad I wish I had take the note pro G + or G + Anyone who to buy this phone , please do n ' t buy the version .
What would you suggest on your perspective is a better phone to buy if i could increase my budget range mi a or .. 😂 what kind of do u test man !
Does this one break like a too and are just bunch of selling their ... : universe 😂 No , no Pay .
The only thing that is missing Too much unnecessary .
For me it it because I ' m just and I ' m so happy because I my money and I bought the phone and happy because its the first one I got by my self its the gold edition I was given also a screen because the people at the shop were nice and the phone Worth ' s but for me it Worth ' s I did n ' t pay but its the feeling of doing something new that was worth it Can you give me a phone thank you Which do you prefer , the f or the mi a ?
Please come in So much awkward video is best Let ' s see Pro M Killer for X How is the battery life ?
The X is than Mi A it is not good as the A but i think that the it ' s not too big and the X is really good to its price Mi A is indeed an amazing device .
I used it myself and it completely until I facing ghost screen issue which could n ' t fix and did n ' t replace .
Try the MI NOTE PRO i hate this mi a I use Nova Launcher because when I change I want the same experience .
No head phone jack Less battery backup No Fast charger in the box Worst ram management Very irritating brightness .
Its a worst deal .
do n ' t have all the for US not sure about Canada .
And no , it ' s not Sandstorm 😂 Loo can you wear a wig for a couple of ?
Does pay support in Mi A ?
The problem I have is the compatibility with .
Sadly it like I ’ have to try and sell it .
sorry for that question but what lens do you use to capture that front face - to - face ?
that like a super wide lens but there is no distortion at all .
Did he get 😂👍 No ?
I broke my X camera glass .
I need a phone for work so bought a Mi A as a stop gap , intending to have the X .
weak battery ?
No doubt why best selling in : Great review !
But its camera is coming on top , in low - light .
For anyone who that its camera is not that great , I ' only ask them for a better one in this price - range .
I do kind of wish he took the out in the re here for camera is easier to prove are so Apple 😂😂 But and a made in the same country I this would not get very good coverage in US is that true ?
A had a problem the proximity sensor was far from speaker and depending where you keep the phone during call it can fail to engage lock screen .
This is such a bad phone , i mean who .
Totally disappointed .. is the best still ...
I think note is better Dude , please do re - review for for the new please .. and .. is it a steal deal for now ?
My old broke and I bought this to hold me over until the comes out .
Here in I would pay € more for the Mi A .
: NO IN US DO N ' T BUY .
I REPEAT , NO IN THE US , DO NOT BUY .
He really should have it , it is trap for US .
Unbox therapy make mistake .😀 In between : Unfortunately , it ' s over in .
It is very bad .
I want a fast phone and good camera , dont care about other nonsense , is this the right one for me ?
Since I don ’ t use outside the home on g i forget when i charge that thing .
Fantastic phone love you sir 😜👌 k check out the the downside the headset men why the god damn earth erase how can you charge ur phone while listening music , except the headset but it while in gaming in after year of I found my favorite channel !

It face unlock Android low key want a phone that like the X but don ’ t want the .
Commence the hate .

dislike = fan I am happy with my thats faster and better than this one Dude how can I get any of these on T Mobile I have a mi a I already have this since it was phone and i have main with it : - no this is so annoying - the phone size is over almost as big as note .
nubia m I miss it I bought mi a two days ago , but the battery very fast to solve this .
man why didnt you post this video a month ago : I just bought a phone for about a month ago Sad to say but any phone headphone jack its no for me Just get a nexus .

Hey can you do a comparison on Evolve , and Key L what if I to use Passport in there a phone which the crazy design of Passport .. to Portrait mode is good if you use it for a human being Worth that the + is Android One as well , and more than decent and build quality .
, it ’ s time to stop .
Why does he never test normal like making a phone call ?
How often the keyboard you press wrong button and so on Mi note pro is better than a Pure Android ?
😂 Can you please do a un - boxing and review of .
Why no one is considering .
I miss the old .
correct it can you make a review of mi it battery power i want to know if its real or fake plus man !
always watch your and i want a powerful phone not the potato phone 😭 from by the ways .
Watching this on Love ❤️❤️ It is + Lost me at pro pro M .. # Headphone jack .
Watching this on a pro m with : D I love the budget segment thanks < pro m , storage ram , battery 🔋 Watching from my are crazy good honestly as good as my old s camera is better tho my grandma plus but i have really old one that is is good aswell it as a daily driver 🔥 I have been waiting and for unable to make a decision for my new phone .
misleading us with `` Android One '' ...
Lots of problem is there ... in , people are crazy for Android one .
🔥 Mi A is only right now limited 🔥 When cost a soul I think I will be switching to android for my next phone .
I currently use it all day everyday because I just got a new phone , I ' m not just gon na leave it laying around 😁 .
My phone was a and I remember the battery was acting strange in the beginning , so I expect the battery to be after a few .
Reading what I just said me think the battery is crap , but I just do n ' t have a problem with it yet .
There is no .
I thought it will be a problem , but now when I got the phone I ' m perfectly fine with it .
There is no card .
As a gallery you have , which your can be saved on the cloud , so if you are short on storage , you can delete from the device and leave them on the cloud that way you can only see them when you have connection .
Verdict : This phone should be enough for everyone , especially for non demanding .
Mi A is a crazy good deal , but F is an even deal .
I thought this could be my next phone until you the lack of a .
The lack of the headphone jack is not the biggest problem , I got used to it pretty quickly .
It actually me when u slam the phone on the table 😐 I just got a mi A lite !
Bless you and your family , and have a good week .😊😊 when your phone same amount of ram as your my ram mi a ram If can get Poco / Mi phone into the android one will destroy that market segment .
No with either .
Not sure why the dont expand their to the North Market .
is cool too No .
, jack .. also does n ' t have an memory and the battery is not so promising .. confused 😕 which one is better than the other ?
make such good for such low .
Apple are insane I for one live on .
pretty sure the correct word is LIMITING still than 😂 and garbage 😂 Crazy how does n ' t make money selling .
It ' s a good daily driver , with of screen on time on Android .. Love how he into his beard every time he a Not + It ' s + It ' s crazy , because the A `` Lite '' version which is and supposed to be worse , at least where it ' s better than the regular `` A version '' .
BRING SO NEW AND BE ITS NOW I really hate Apple for starting the trend + !
Was just nervous I was the best deal .
Now I have a swollen arm , a broken table and my is shouting from down below .
is killing it 🔥 just bought Mi A / Global for my wife .
more and dynamic range but one better low light .
If you want a phone with just clean and snappy stock feeling , for this price range you wont get a better phone .
🔥 Must check it out Watching this on my mi A 😍 I am watching this from my Mi A Gold version right now .
still in love with my A , this brand is crazy good for its price tag so there are universe now .
All their android device are Android ONE some of them are tough fight for the A Just bought one of these today , super , awesome build quality , and buttery smooth , highly recommend this please do a review of Pro M .
About the headphone jack problem : let ' s be real , who to music while charging anyways .
This is insane it ' s funny that the more budget A lite a notch on it If I buy this I ' have to buy a M C type cord because i only have old on this price .
Hei it ' s Rear cam : not : Try pro M Love your video format and style , thanks 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 can you make a video for `` note pro '' too : P Does compatible with G ?
They ' re not that good .
Confused !
The battery life is bad , the a lite is batter at that , but still both are the best at that price Thanks for the information .
Finally got the red edition at with full warranty .. Its a steal deal .
stopping punching your desk !
🔥🔥🔥 ANOTHER ONE If you wonder what track is at : it ' s Petrified and recently by yours truly : D A Lite is much better .
if only it had headphone and battery i would get it but hour is unacceptable A Lite is heavy , more battery .
❤️ The light version is something like half the power of this one I have respect for someone who respect for stock android ^ _ ^ I ' m between A Lite , P Smart , J and G Play for my re missing of all : Consider this phone : Note pro many say plus is better big battery , better camera and ... should review the Plus Which mobile is best to buy in budget minimum n express is safe to buy compare it with .
the rear camera is actually plus The only I miss in these are mi a RAM or mi a RAM ?
plus This or the G Plus was thinking of the Mi A but the photo comparison does not look as good as the G plus ?
I WILL GO FOR POCO F If it only had .. watching on my Mi A I almost went for this but went for a Poco because it ' s processor is insane Unbox therapy always quality .
No not nice mi a Does works in on Mi A ?
note pro Check it Correction about rear camera specification , time stamp : you said + it ' s should be + If he Rapping one day his name should be Unbox The 😂 such a random thought .. review the plus !

misleading us with `` Android One '' ...
Lots of problem is there ... in , people are crazy for Android one .
🔥 Mi A is only right now limited 🔥 When cost a soul I think I will be switching to android for my next phone .
I currently use it all day everyday because I just got a new phone , I ' m not just gon na leave it laying around 😁 .
My phone was a and I remember the battery was acting strange in the beginning , so I expect the battery to be after a few .
Reading what I just said me think the battery is crap , but I just do n ' t have a problem with it yet .
There is no .
I thought it will be a problem , but now when I got the phone I ' m perfectly fine with it .
There is no card .
As a gallery you have , which your can be saved on the cloud , so if you are short on storage , you can delete from the device and leave them on the cloud that way you can only see them when you have connection .
Verdict : This phone should be enough for everyone , especially for non demanding .
Mi A is a crazy good deal , but F is an even deal .
I thought this could be my next phone until you the lack of a .
The lack of the headphone jack is not the biggest problem , I got used to it pretty quickly .
It actually me when u slam the phone on the table 😐 I just got a mi A lite !
Bless you and your family , and have a good week .😊😊 when your phone same amount of ram as your my ram mi a ram If can get Poco / Mi phone into the android one will destroy that market segment .
No with either .
Not sure why the dont expand their to the North Market .
is cool too No .
, jack .. also does n ' t have an memory and the battery is not so promising .. confused 😕 which one is better than the other ?
make such good for such low .
Apple are insane I for one live on .
pretty sure the correct word is LIMITING still than 😂 and garbage 😂 Crazy how does n ' t make money selling .
It ' s a good daily driver , with of screen on time on Android .. Love how he into his beard every time he a Not + It ' s + It ' s crazy , because the A `` Lite '' version which is and supposed to be worse , at least where it ' s better than the regular `` A version '' .
BRING SO NEW AND BE ITS NOW I really hate Apple for starting the trend + !
Was just nervous I was the best deal .
Now I have a swollen arm , a broken table and my is shouting from down below .
is killing it 🔥 just bought Mi A / Global for my wife .
more and dynamic range but one better low light .
If you want a phone with just clean and snappy stock feeling , for this price range you wont get a better phone .
🔥 Must check it out Watching this on my mi A 😍 I am watching this from my Mi A Gold version right now .
still in love with my A , this brand is crazy good for its price tag so there are universe now .
All their android device are Android ONE some of them are tough fight for the A Just bought one of these today , super , awesome build quality , and buttery smooth , highly recommend this please do a review of Pro M .
About the headphone jack problem : let ' s be real , who to music while charging anyways .
This is insane it ' s funny that the more budget A lite a notch on it If I buy this I ' have to buy a M C type cord because i only have old on this price .
Hei it ' s Rear cam : not : Try pro M Love your video format and style , thanks 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼 can you make a video for `` note pro '' too : P Does compatible with G ?
They ' re not that good .
Confused !
The battery life is bad , the a lite is batter at that , but still both are the best at that price Thanks for the information .
Finally got the red edition at with full warranty .. Its a steal deal .
stopping punching your desk !
🔥🔥🔥 ANOTHER ONE If you wonder what track is at : it ' s Petrified and recently by yours truly : D A Lite is much better .
if only it had headphone and battery i would get it but hour is unacceptable A Lite is heavy , more battery .
❤️ The light version is something like half the power of this one I have respect for someone who respect for stock android ^ _ ^ I ' m between A Lite , P Smart , J and G Play for my re missing of all : Consider this phone : Note pro many say plus is better big battery , better camera and ... should review the Plus Which mobile is best to buy in budget minimum n express is safe to buy compare it with .
the rear camera is actually plus The only I miss in these are mi a RAM or mi a RAM ?
plus This or the G Plus was thinking of the Mi A but the photo comparison does not look as good as the G plus ?
I WILL GO FOR POCO F If it only had .. watching on my Mi A I almost went for this but went for a Poco because it ' s processor is insane Unbox therapy always quality .
No not nice mi a Does works in on Mi A ?
note pro Check it Correction about rear camera specification , time stamp : you said + it ' s should be + If he Rapping one day his name should be Unbox The 😂 such a random thought .. review the plus !
I was wondering because i mostly see and and i thought ur advertising them , so no for for my conclusion ... And now a was really because u now had up recently .
More fun 😉 is great on the lower budget end and definitely than the more notable ' `` budget `` for .

No point .
Try pro m Yes like your channel so much Just got my A and hell yeah !
The only problem is .
: that one was for apple i guess 😂 Battery did not last very long s the of this phone !
pro m ram No jack and a battery biggest let down .
did n ' t you check new My d be lost if you cut he ' s arms off I would prefer the note you did n ' t use the toy man for the camera test .

I like the aggressiveness that you showcase in your presentation Can u do one on the recent android one like one power and .
You pay less but get more .

SONG USED TO TEST OUT THE AUDIO Petrified by ENJOY !
No man .
Worst quality audio even in too .
About week ago I ' bought Mi A and now I ' m learning my grandma to use it and it ' s on a great way : D : is a great program , Sadly Mi A no jack for and no slot for , but it ' s not a problem with internal space and it comes with port for , or you can just do a step forward and use a one .
take a shot every time he the table Lew , is his channel `` '' about three of which are : - Poor calling sound quality , - Poor audio when recording a video and - Poor video recording .
I swear to god if i see Van here again What about Mi A Lite ?
Recently was Damn .
i prefer nova i over this This is a seriously good device in the range .
please You can go for note pro for faster finger print reader Really miss the ...
I have gotten used to those simple yet dependable that I ' m so much trouble on a new phone as my current one is slowly dying know but yet not wanting to leave behind that familiar program .
sigh no screen protector in the box ?
inch display + Rear Camera Front Camera MAN IT IS PRETTY GOOD ITS PRICE BUT NO HEADPHONE JACK 😢 I suggest pro m ram / battery pro is better I bought one a few ago amazing device bought it here in canada on for after Song that he ?
My mate pro face hardware problem so I went to get a spare phone , which is this .
I fell in love with it and probably will stay with it though mate pro might be better camera actually r almost the same too much hot air guff Watching this from my mi a lite 😊 Lew did you tried the Pro variant , not good as Mi A but still good .
When I block the left one it does the same real me pro may beat mi a in camera section Review the mi a lite I wan na see if it really hardware that this one does n ' t and how well it up for the price Poco f is better 🔥 If only Jack was present Pro ?
The S edge can be bought for less than right now so I think that ' s a better deal I like your review , no I love your 😄 what you think about note ?
not where do you get these music it is damn good I prefer a lite .
You got one wrong .
Mi A comes with a + camera , not + No headphone jack = Deal breaker You are amazing I blame Lew for tempting me buy so many and my wallet .
Correction : rear cam its + not + , , , welcome to the dawn of `` '' .. Man your the best I ' m glad I found this channel I really want to step outside of the normal phone prison I ' m sick of Front dual camera ?
Damn great 🤔🙌 Watching on MI A go video for MI ram Had it for a week , camera is really really good , could not ask for more .
is still better coz of t he battery life , storage and a headphone jack , while the A a type c port and better camera and also a better processor but it ' s not worth the sacrifice at least for me , oh and the Note is also about This was going to be my next phone until I took that headphone jack part a bit seriously .
This way , life would be hard for me .
No fancy .
My kind of which is practical too coz it does n ' t damage or make it loose .
No headphone jack = no buy Watching this video in my mi a I want honor play phone .
Plus pro what if i ' m poor Test the a lite trust me it ’ s good I have it and I am fully satisfied by mi a I use mi a lite I like it but its is n ' t worthy on specs 😊 Unbox mi The smaller brother over here , the mi a lite .
do the A lite one I still do n ' t understand why A Lite is better than the A ... No notch yes buy Apart from the lack of Jack and small battery capacity , this phone ' s value it ' s price .
watching this on my Mi a lite This is the worst i bought , get disconnected if the get even headset .
: the name , i ' m gon na die if i do n ' t find that cursed name this phone is a mixture of the display and front of and the of apple X i still think the A is better Pro in Best thing in this phone is Android one and lower price .
Solid as hell .
plus This would be the perfect phone if it were n ' t for the lack of slot and headphone jack Bought mi a after watching this At : it ' s + which is the only reason to buy it against poco 😑 If not headphone jack they should have given battery coz by plug in again and again it battery faster and just wo n ' t last for a day Watching it in my mi a 😗 I ' m getting mine tomorrow !
+ rear camera mi a 🔥 Bad thing that this is now the most affordable phone with no headphone jack Does Apple work on IT ?
Other review i am sick man now its therapy channel Z and cool Try to compare it to pro m .. same mid range phone ..
Damn .
Poco Phone is much better Deal than the Mi A 😝😝 Used essential phone or used v And i think that the its better than how i think @ me I ' m that you do n ' t mention anything about the battery problem look up the about this phone it the battery like no other phone Hay .. Just want to say man ...
It ' s a really good phone , mid - range , on smoothly on Medium and minor lag on High .
The camera , no .
Epic review , but why do u listen to that so weird Love From 🇮🇳 Can you give me one even only the power !
How would you rank them from best to worst ?
poor people ' s , especially 😂 I ' m the previous version A , and have with camera video recording .
It can sometimes drop frame to and video and audio goes out of sync .
that it ' s an OS problem .
I love how Unbox Therapy is n ' t a Phone Snob .
of tech and think just because they have experienced real high end they can talk down on .. like they ' re not good enough or something .
Still fighting with its battery .
Do n ' t forget the phone 😂😂 note or ?
Is there sill problem with the proximity sensor or it been fixed already ?
Check out the Mi SE , it just more , for that you ' re getting more performance , a glass - metal construction , Super , are way smaller , it ' s quite a bit faster with a better , snapdragon and it does n ' t drop any of the good stuff from the Mi A , it ' s basically the premium version , and it up much better in of value to some .
Same with the F , it all the praise but for just a little more money you solve all the that the Poco F , but it ' s so Is it Stock Android U r best Bought the device to try it out , overall a good device but connection is pretty weak while my connection at home is very fast .
All the on this device seem weak while it ' s fine on paper .
I tried and and all that but the mobile connection and are on the low end , speed wise .
The rear camera is + for low light U need to try note pro It plus camera Good but with all the around and jumpy I ' m gon na need therapy myself .
Great camera in a very low budget 😋 : it ' s not + ...
I am quite confused been for a long time and i feel they are over priced for nothing .
what do you think of the Mi A lite I my mobile to and it ' s amazing does this phone do ¡¿¡¿ It ' s really annoying how all these great budget do n ' t have US .
se or A HELP 🙏🙏🙏 I ' m gon na buy one : v it was all great , until there was no , no tap to pay no your phone for casual , making it completely useless .
so angry .
I have bad experience with getting slow over time and that ' s why I do n ' t trust How is the brightness on it ?
I do n ' t know anyone who this one I have a v and % of people do n ' t know what the v - series is what a crazy world Do Honor X !
I ca n ' t find it Try note No headphone jack tho ?
O You will replace it after week to galaxy s + 😂 Make video on mate pro Do the mi a lite version f or this one ?
I will prefer the latter no matter what Very rightly said .
buy a new phone and confused between A and poco f , so i need help note pro is better G you can get it for used but in great condition .
Real me pro is almost performance ... much better the price .. lower than up .. crazy to think that these at this price point would compete and beat some flagship of a few ago and even put up a fight with the new Does this work with at & t ?
The camera binning thing which in low light .
No Headphone jack sad If it was waterproof then yes , but its not so no .
s own note is a better deal : Expendable Storage , Bigger Battery , Almost as powerful `` Snapdragon `` , no imbalance , better display , almost similar camera experience .. sure it is n ' t Android One .. but there are stock android for it .
In love with this phone And still my second choice in the range even after a year of use 😍😍😍 First would be obviously ✌️✌️✌️ U r very serious today I am pro m at I bought it just ago !
It ' s also stock Android phone but it ' s not Android one phone and camera is little worse than this but still pretty good for and it snapdragon which is pretty good but behind a little bit in comparison to snapdragon Edit - it a battery so you can go to with this and leave your charger at home 😂 you will not find any power in thought 🤣 : song ?
were but no response from Mi yet Note pro How ' s Mi A to .
watching this on mi x 😭😭😭😭 No one can challenge mi with the price range Hey do the video of note Please , have never seen being unboxed reason ?
Mi A Lite , I am it right now .. 😃 Song name any I am a mi user mi is the worst company I had ever used i becomes heat and lag very much during gaming Is .
Plus Still prefer the Poco , it better and it me because every budget phone so generic nowadays that ' s boring to look at well i love android but i hate their , not simple ... thats why i love coz are ex user Radioactivity well your light was good I have that exact color and it pink and not gold Best phone ever on a is the most important aspect for me .
I know , I know , that is difficult to come what about a phone like the plus ?
I mean for an with ram , Bad screen durability .
But Camera is not so good .
And also , whats wrong with a headphone jack .
I would not be getting a mi A The headphone jack removal is simply a bad move , the phone does not need to be thinner than it was back in Mi A You ca n ' t even hold it without a case anyway .
And the removal of the jack did n ' t even mean that more battery life was added to it , instead it was made worse ?
There is no to expand your storage here .
They may have upon the camera , but it is worse than Mi A on all .
I have the mi a it ' s a very good phone for gaming but the battery is really really bad I wish I had take the note pro G + or G + Anyone who to buy this phone , please do n ' t buy the version .
What would you suggest on your perspective is a better phone to buy if i could increase my budget range mi a or .. 😂 what kind of do u test man !
Does this one break like a too and are just bunch of selling their ... : universe 😂 No , no Pay .
The only thing that is missing Too much unnecessary .
For me it it because I ' m just and I ' m so happy because I my money and I bought the phone and happy because its the first one I got by my self its the gold edition I was given also a screen because the people at the shop were nice and the phone Worth ' s but for me it Worth ' s I did n ' t pay but its the feeling of doing something new that was worth it Can you give me a phone thank you Which do you prefer , the f or the mi a ?
Please come in So much awkward video is best Let ' s see Pro M Killer for X How is the battery life ?
The X is than Mi A it is not good as the A but i think that the it ' s not too big and the X is really good to its price Mi A is indeed an amazing device .
I used it myself and it completely until I facing ghost screen issue which could n ' t fix and did n ' t replace .
Try the MI NOTE PRO i hate this mi a I use Nova Launcher because when I change I want the same experience .
No head phone jack Less battery backup No Fast charger in the box Worst ram management Very irritating brightness .
Its a worst deal .
do n ' t have all the for US not sure about Canada .
And no , it ' s not Sandstorm 😂 Loo can you wear a wig for a couple of ?
Does pay support in Mi A ?
The problem I have is the compatibility with .
Sadly it like I ’ have to try and sell it .
